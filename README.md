### FAQS

**What format should my private key be in?** 

The private key should be in the base58 string format, not bytes. 

**Why are my transactions being dropped?** 

You get what you pay for. Don't use the main-net RPC, just spend the money for Helius or Quick Node.

**How do I change the fee?** 

Modify the UNIT_BUDGET and UNIT_PRICE in the constants.py.
